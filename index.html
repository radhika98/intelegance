		<p id = pitch>During the 1980s, 37% of women in college graduated with an undergraduate degree in computer science according to NCES(National Center for Educational Statistics). But by the end of that same year, something changed. Now, the number hovers around 18%.
		Women stopped coding. Instead of young girls growing up with an interest in coding from role models like Grace Hopper or Ada Lovelace, 
		they grew up with condescending comments like &quot;Sweetie, let your brother do that&quot; or &quot;Dear you shouldn&#39;t do that, it&#39;s a guy thing&quot;. 
And that&#39;s where we come in. By reaching out to girls who should code as girls who code, we can set them on a track towards hardcore sciences. We address the misconception that girls can&#39;t do things as well as a guy can.
