# intelegance



This is the first website I ever created, called intelegance (it's a play on words with intelligence, int and elegance :)). 

This website incorporates two games that help the player understand basic concepts of programming. The games were programmed in Javascript and HMTL and I used Phaser (an open source HTML5 game framework) and Cloud9 (an online code editor). 


In the first game, it's Christmas and you have match the correct present with the correct girl, allowing the palyer to learn about variables, and the second game is a version of snake where everytime the snake eats the food with a name above it, that name gets appended to an array. 

The purpose of these games is to introduce young children to basic concepts of programming in a fun way. If children are exposed to these basic ideas at a young age, then when they actually learn it, it won't seem so difficult!
